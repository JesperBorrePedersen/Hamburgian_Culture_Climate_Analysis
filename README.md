## Getting Started
This repository contains the code and the archaeological data required to replicate the analysis. However, the by-centruy temperature and preciptations estimates from the CHELSA Trace21k dataset that from the base of the model fits and predictions are also needed. The CHELSA Trace21k dataset is currenlty in review and not publicly available yet, upon publicaition of the dataset it will be made publicly avilable via (chelsa-climate.org) and we will update this section with instructions on how to import the data.

The folder structure of this repostiroy and the software requirements for the anlysis are outlined below. All code required for the analysis and reproduction of the figures can be found in the `scripts\analysis.R` script. It can best be navigated via an editor or IDE that allows for R code section indexing such as RStudio. 

### Software
The analysis was developed and carried out in R. Using the following packages: ...
