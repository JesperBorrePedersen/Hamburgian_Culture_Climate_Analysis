## Getting Started
This repository contains the code and the archaeological data required to replicate our analysis. However, the by-centruy temperature and preciptations raster data from the CHELSA Trace21k dataset are also needed. These predictor data fotm the basis of the model fits and predictions themselves. The CHELSA Trace21k dataset is currenlty in review and not publicly available yet. We will update this section upon public release of the data.  

The folder structure of this repostiroy and the software requirements for the anlysis are outlined below. 

All code required for the analysis and reproduction of the figures can be found in the `scripts\analysis.R` script. The code is structured using RStudio section delinations to help naviagation within the script. 

### Software
The analysis was developed and carried out in R. Using the following packages: ADD LIST!
