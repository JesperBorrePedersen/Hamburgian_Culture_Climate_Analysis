There is a file "timecodes.txt" which gives the timecode of the CHELSA layers (0-210) and the respective years BP.
 
otherwise the code is as follows:

CHELSA_TraCE_ps_[timecode]_1_biascor: ps= mean total surface precipitation (100 years average) unit = mm
CHELSA_TraCE_tas_[timecode]: tas = mean annual temperature at surface (100 years average) unit = Celsius/10 (to get Celsius devide by 10).
